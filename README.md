# RTI Anywhere

An unofficial Flask app using the unofficial Metlink API for fast Wellington Bus Real Time Information for stops that lack dedicated RTI signs. Hosted at [rti.petras.space](https://rti.petras.space).

The Metlink app is great... except that it's really slow, and I have a cheap phone. Hopefully the promised new version will be an improvement, but in the meantime I coded this in an evening after I got too frustrated.

The primary python dependencies are `flask` and `flask-table`. A debug version of the program can be launched with `python rti.py`.
